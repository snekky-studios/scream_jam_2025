## Narration

## Opening
As you have heard, South Fork, Iowa is gone. Nothing now but dust and ruin.
Nothing has been recovered, except photos scattered throughout the wreckage.
Their subjects appear benign; we can't tell what their purpose is. We are missing something.
We need someone with your skillset to examine them. Tell us what you see.

## After 3rd Picture
These photos feel familiar somehow. It's hard to explain.
Have I seen them before? I can almost remember this town, though I've never been there.
I've stared so long, and yet I can't see the things you do. Maybe if I keep looking...

## After 6th Picture
I feel different. The photos call to me.
I can feel them, like a thought tickling the back of my brain.
We must hurry. Something feels very wrong.
